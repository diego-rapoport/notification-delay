# Notify-Delay CLI
Just a simples cli that uses `notify-send` to send a notification with a message in a specific time of the day or in seconds.  
It is blocking the terminal when it runs.

# Usage
Just run with `--help` to see the usage and some examples.

It's a free and open source project, so feel free to contribute! I don't plan to have strict roadmap and many improvements.
